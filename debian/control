Description: A twisted-based Juju client.

# TODO: Add a separate package for txjuju/testing.py?
# This would entail a second package entry here like the following,
# as well as changes in setup.py and the addition of debian/*.install
# files for both packages.  At that point we'd also remove the two
# testing-related packages from "Depends:" above.  Ultimately it
# probably isn't worth the trouble and extra complexity.
